            <h1>The Sun</h1>
            <p class="intro">The Sun is the largest object within our solar system, comprising 99.8% of the system’s mass ,the Sun is located at the center of our solar system, and Earth orbits 93 million miles away from it,though massive, the Sun still isn’t as large as other types of stars. It’s classified as a yellow dwarf star.the Sun's magnetic field spreads throughout the solar system via the solar wind.</p>
            <p>The Sun—the heart of our solar system—is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases.</p>
            <p>Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest particles of debris in its orbit. Electric currents in the Sun generate a magnetic field that is carried out through the solar system by the solar wind—a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions.</p>
            <p>The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and aurorae. Though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
